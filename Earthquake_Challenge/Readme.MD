# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the visualization of world-wide earthquake data.  
Overlayed on any of 3 map styles (Streets, Satellite, and Dark) the user can choose to view:
- The location and magnitude of all earthquakes recorded in the last 7 days.
- The location and magnitude of all major earthquakes recorded in the last 7 days.
- The tectonic plates bounderies.  

The user can choose which of these three to view in any combination.

The magnitudes of the earthquakes are highlighted by the size and color of the circular markers, and the user can see the exact magnitude and location of each earthquake by clicking on the its marker.
